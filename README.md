# Predicting Race Positions in Formula 1


Because the repository has gotten a bit messy over time, we provide quick links for the most important files and folders.

- **[Approach 1](https://github.com/fengelnsbauer/ie500-data-mining-group7/tree/main/approach_10)**: Contains all models and the data that we initially trained on the race position dataset.
- **[Approach 2](https://github.com/fengelnsbauer/ie500-data-mining-group7/tree/main/approach_20)**: Contains code for the seconds approach XGBoost
- **[Data](https://github.com/fengelnsbauer/ie500-data-mining-group7/tree/main/data)**: Contains the data raw data from the APIs/F1nalyze Datathon and the data use for the first approach.

- **[Neural Networks on Old Data Set](https://github.com/fengelnsbauer/ie500-data-mining-group7/blob/main/neural_net)**: Experimentations with neural networks on race position dataset
- **[Neural Network on New Data Set](https://github.com/fengelnsbauer/ie500-data-mining-group7/blob/main/approach_20/neural_net.ipynb)**: Contains all code for training and evaluating the neural network on the lap-by-lap dataset

- **[Simplified](https://github.com/fengelnsbauer/ie500-data-mining-group7/tree/main/simplified)**: Contains code for the second approach's regression and baseline, as well as a simplified modelling and simulation framework
- **[Archive](https://github.com/fengelnsbauer/ie500-data-mining-group7/tree/main/archive)**: Experimentations with neural networks on race position dataset
- **[Documents](https://github.com/fengelnsbauer/ie500-data-mining-group7/tree/main/documents)**: PDF Files, Paper References, Kaggle explainations
