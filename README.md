# Predicting Race Positions in Formula 1


Because the repository has gotten a bit messy over time, we provide quick links for the most important files and folders.

- **[Approach 1](https://github.com/fengelnsbauer/ie500-data-mining-group7/tree/main/approach_01)**: Contains all models and the data that we initially trained on the race position dataset.
- **[Approach 1 Dataset](https://github.com/fengelnsbauer/ie500-data-mining-group7/tree/main/data)**: Contains the data for the first approach (race position)

- **[Neural Networks on Old Data Set](https://github.com/fengelnsbauer/ie500-data-mining-group7/blob/main/neural_net)**: Experimentations with neural networks on race position dataset
- **[Neural Network on New Data Set](https://github.com/fengelnsbauer/ie500-data-mining-group7/blob/main/lap_simulation/neural_net.ipynb)**: Contains all code for training and evaluating the neural network on the lap-by-lap dataset
